What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a new repository on the directory we are in. It will create a git file for the exsiting files and we can now control different versions of project
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area acts like a medium to between git and working directory and gives more control over the commits
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Staging area will help to review changes before comitting and also will help make commits in smaller portions.
